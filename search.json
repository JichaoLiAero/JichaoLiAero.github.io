We address this issue by developing ways to overcome robustness issues arising from shape parametrization, mesh deformation, and flow solver convergence. Our approach is demonstrated on the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG) airfoil optimization benchmarks to show the factors that dominate the robustness and efficiency. In the ADODG NACA 0012 benchmark, we address the additional issue of non-unique solutions. In the ADODG RAE 2822 case, we address solver failure due to shock waves, separation, and gradient accuracies due to the frozen turbulence model. Finally, we create a new, challenging aerodynamic shape optimization case that starts with a circle to test the robustness of our aerodynamic shape optimization framework. We use both fixed and adaptive parametrization methods to tackle this problem and show how we can exploit the advantages of adaptive parametrization methods to improve both robustness and efficiency. The combination of flow solver robustness, precision of gradient information, robust mesh deformation, and adaptive parametrization brings us closer to a “push-button” solution for airfoil design.","tags":[],"title":"Robust aerodynamic shape optimization—From a circle to an airfoil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jichao Li","J.

In order to overcome this issue, we adopt a snapshot active subspace method to reduce the input dimension. A smoothing operation of samples is used to reduce the demand for snapshots in the construction of active subspaces. This operation significantly reduces the computational cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, it leads to more feasible subspaces. We use a 90% ∼ 95% energy coverage criterion to define the dimension of the subspace. With this criterion, the surrogate-based airfoil optimization in the active subspace is both efficient and effective. We also validate this optimization approach in an ONERA M6 wing optimization case with 220 shape variables. Compared with original surrogate-based optimization, the new approach reduces the computational time by 70% and obtains a more practical design with a smaller drag.","tags":[],"title":"Surrogate-based aerodynamic shape optimization with the active subspace method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jichao Li","M.

Next, a reduced-order model is set up via proper orthogonal decomposition with the reuse of ready-made flow snapshots in the first-step optimization. A proper-orthogonal-decomposition Petrov-Galerkin method is investigated to provide fast flow predictions in the second-step optimization. With the assistance of an error estimation method and an automatic domain-decomposition method that are presented in this paper, the sensitive domain in the computational grid is split out. To improve the accuracy, predictions provided by proper orthogonal decomposition in the sensitive domain are further corrected by computational fluid dynamics modifications. Meanwhile, in order to accelerate gradient solutions, the adjoint equation of this proper orthogonal decomposition and domain-decomposition-based flow analysis method is derived and discussed.

We use camber and thickness mode shapes derived from over one thousand existing airfoils to parameterize the airfoil shape, which reduces the number of design variables. More than one hundred thousand RANS evaluations associated with different airfoils and flow conditions (M, AoA) are selected in a well-defined way to obtain aerodynamic coefficients ($C_l$, $C_d$ and $C_m$) and their gradients. The gradients for the RANS evaluations are computed using an adjoint method. This data is used to train a surrogate model that combines gradient-enhanced kriging, partial least squares (GE-KPLS), and mixture of experts. Two global models composed of dozens of GE-KPLS models are constructed in the subsonic and transonic regimes. These surrogate models provide fast aerodynamic analysis and gradient computation, which are coupled with a gradient-based optimizer to perform rapid airfoil shape design optimization. In a validating test of 2741 airfoils and 989 airfoils in the subsonic and transonic regimes, the mean differences of the surrogate models from RANS evaluations in the drag coefficient are 0.09 and 0.8 counts, respectively.

Firstly, a reduced-order model for the forward problem (forward ROM) is constructed, where Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is adopted. To meet the demand of general PDE systems, Petrov-Galerkin projection is adopted to solve the forward ROM. Afterwards, the adjoint ROM is constructed based on the POD-Petrov-Galerkin ROM. Due to the use of Petrov-Galerkin projection in solving the forward ROM, the formula of the adjoint ROM is rather complicated with system Hessian matrices brought in it. The cost of computing and storing these matrices might make it not worthwhile to compute sensitivities by this approach. In order to overcome this issue, a simplified formula of the adjoint ROM for general PDE problem is proposed with proper assumptions and omissions. Finally, numerical validations of the accuracy and efficiency by this adjoint ROM approach are presented with three cases, a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle flow case, an inviscid NACA0012 airfoil case and a viscous RAE2822 airfoil case. The results indicate that the computational cost by the adjoint ROM can be dramatically saved, and the sensitivities obtained by this approach are generally close to those computed by the traditional adjoint method.","tags":[],"title":"Adjoint Approach based on Reduced-order Model for Steady PDE Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

In the fields like flow stability analysis, aeroelastic analysis, aerodynamic optimization and flow control, from the viewpoint of dynamics system, the system matrix of a CFD model can be constructed for quantitative analysis, obtaining more systematic information about the CFD model. However, CFD model is a complicated high order nonlinear system. It is difficult to construct the system matrix directly. In this paper, automatic differential method is cooperated with manual coding to construct the Jacobian of a parallel finite volume CFD solver based on multiblock structured grid. Automatic differential is applied to obtaining the local Jacobian of the flux across each interface. And by means of manual coding, each local Jacobian is assembled into the global distributed sparse Jacobian. In order to solve the linearized system, preconditioned GMRES method is adopted. In the parallel environment, the block Jacobi preconditioner is used while ILU(0) preconditioner is applied to each parallel thread. In the numerical tests, this procedure is applied to 1) constructing and solving the linear system of an unsteady flow around NACA0012 airfoil; 2) sensitivity analysis based on the adjoint equation for a steady flow of NACA0012 airfoil; 3) reduced order modeling for the aeroelastic problem of AGARD wing 445.6. The results agree excellently with the data of CFD simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Method of linearizing computational fluid dynamics model and its applications","type":"publication"}]
